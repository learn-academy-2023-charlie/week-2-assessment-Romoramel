Your answer: one is a named variable passed into a function and the other is a way to provide more info to ao function.

Researched answer: argument:An argument is a way for you to provide more information to a function. A parameter is a named variable passed into a function

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: strings and arrays?

Researched answer: The built-in JavaScript array methods that help us iterate are called iteration methods, at times referred to as iterators. Iterators are methods called on arrays to manipulate elements and return values. Executes the same code for each element of an array

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map breaks up every element and its return value and filter is an array that passes a test.

Researched answer: The built-in JavaScript array methods that help us iterate are called iteration methods, at times referred to as iterators. Iterators are methods called on arrays to manipulate elements and return values. Executes the same code for each element of an array. The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Components are independent and reusable bits of code

2. Spread operator: allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React state: a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component

4. React props: stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another

5. DOM events: When a user clicks the mouse.
When a web page has loaded.
When an image has been loaded.
When the mouse moves over an element.
When an input field is changed.
When an HTML form is submitted.
